## What is it?

A consistent method of storing state about async calls with the goal of reducing boilerplate in react code

```jsx harmony
// plain js
import {useAsyncState} from "react-async-stateful";

const AsyncComponent = (props) => {
    const [submitResult, _, updateSubmitResult] = useAsyncState();    

    const submit = useCallback(() => {
        const {resolvedAt} = updateSubmitResult(async () => {
            const response = await fetch("https://example.com/api/v1/squeal-loudly");
            return response.json();
        });
        console.log(`API responded at: ${new Date(resolvedAt).toString()}`)
    });
    
    return <div>
        <button onClick={submit}>Call the API!</button>
        {submitResult.resolved && <div>The response: {JSON.stringify(submitResult.value)}</div>}
    </div>;
};
```

### Demos

- [API Example](https://react-async-stateful.netlify.com/api)

## useAsyncState hook

The `useAsyncState` hook returns:

```jsx harmony
    const [asyncState, setAsyncState, updateAsyncState] = useAsyncState(defaultValue);
``` 

- `asyncState` is the the current value of the async state
- `setAsyncState` is usually never needed but can be useful to synchronously update the state, eg:
    ```jsx harmony
  import {resolve} from "react-async-stateful";

  const updateFromLocalStorage = () => {
      setAsyncState(asyncState => {
          const value = localStorage.getItem("key");
          return resolve(asyncState, value);
      });
  };
    ```
- `updateAsyncState` is the recommended way of updating. It will automatically update the state and re-render your component with a pending state allowing you to dipslay loading spinners ect.
    ```jsx harmony
  const submit = useCallback(() => {
      updateAsyncState(/*promise or an async function*/ async () => {
          const response = await api.get(`user/${userId}`); // thrown errors are automatically handled
          const user = formatUserObject(response.data);
          return user;
      });
  }, [userId]);
  
  // component will receive:
  asyncState.pending === true
  
  // then
  asyncState.resolved === true
  asyncState.value    === user // resolved value
  
  // or if a rejection
  asyncState.rejected === true
  asyncState.error    === Error // error instance
    ```

## Submit vs Refresh

The default behaviour is that when the `updateAsyncState` function is called, the current value and errors are wiped and the state is put into an empty pending state.

This can be undesirable if you are merely refreshing data and want to keep the previous value whilst the new request is being made. To fix this you can pass the `refresh` option so that these are kept:

```jsx harmony
const refreshList = () => {
    updateList(async () => {
        const response = await api.get("list");
        return response.data;
    }, {refresh: true} /* <-- keep the current value whilst we are pending */);
};
```

_whether submit or refresh were used is stored as `submitType` on the async state object_

## The AsyncState object

**Note:** All operations on async state **do not** mutate the original object

```typescript jsx
// typescript
import * as AsyncState from "react-async-stateful";

// creating the state
const state = AsyncState.create("hello");
console.log(state.pristine); // true
console.log(state.value); // hello

// resolving the state
const resolvedState = AsyncState.resolve(state, "world");
console.log(state.resolved); // true
console.log(state.value); // world

```

#### Properties

| key            | type                                  | description
| ---            | ---                                   | --- 
| `defaultValue` | `T` or `undefined`                    | default value set at the object creation    
| `pristine`     | `boolean`                             | have we been updated yet?
| `pending`      | `boolean`                             | is there an update to the state happening now?
| `pendingAt`    | `number` or `null`                    | when the update started
| `resolved`     | `boolean`                             | do we have a resolved value? if this is true then `value` must not be `undefined`
| `resolvedAt`   | `number` or `null`                    | when the value the was resolved    
| `rejected`     | `boolean`                             | if an error occurred or the update was rejected. if this is true then `error` must not be `undefined`
| `rejectedAt`   | `number` or `null`                    | when the rejection happened ðŸ˜¢
| `settled`      | `boolean`                             | if the object is resolved/rejected and not pending
| `settledAt`    | `number` or `null`                    | when it was settled
| `value`        | `T` or `undefined`                    | the currently resolved value, if `undefined` we are not resolved    
| `error`        | `Error` or `undefined`                | the reason for the rejection, if `undefined` we are not rejected        
| `submitType`   | `AsyncStateSubmitType` or `undefined` | what kind of submit was it? can be either `submit` or `refresh`                        

## Typescript Utils

Typescript has a cool feature allowing you to narrow the type of an object using methods. Supplied are some methods that will make null checking your async state objects easier:

```typescript jsx
import {isResolved, useAsyncstate} from "react-async-stateful";

const [asyncState, _, updateAsyncState] = useAsyncstate<UserData>();

runUpdateThatWillHappenInTheFuture();

/* Typescript will complain about the line below ðŸ˜« 
   Even though our library provides a contract that if resolved is true
   `value` cannot be undefined the typescript compiler has no way of knowing this! */
// return asyncState.resolved ? <div>{asyncState.value.id}</div> : "Loading";

// Use `isResolved` and the compiler will be happy that it is definitely present:
return isResolved(asyncState) ? <div>{asyncState.value.id}</div> : "Loading";
```
